                <h3>Sanskrit shloka (Verse) memorising mobile application</h3>
                <p>Summary: an application for iOS and Android mobile devices written in Flutter that will help practitioners of Vedic spiritual traditions, yoga practitioners and students, and Sanskrit language learners to memorise verses from Sanskrit literature and their translations into vernacular languages of today, aiding it by visual aids, word-for-word translation and grammatical notes, spaced repetition, visual feedback etc. </p>
                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>This iOS and Android application will provide users with the ability to memorise and test the recall of popular Sanskrit verses and aphorisms. It will allow them to choose the verses to learn and practice, and help them do that, both in a visual and auditory manner. They will be able to see and hear the verse and its translation, as well as that of the individual words along with grammatical information to aid memorisation. They will also be able to test themselves with the verse obscured from their view but with the ability to highlight and see individual words and their translations. They will be able to mark lines as memorised. The application will also prompt them at different intervals based on spaced repetition techniques to recall the verses and to make sure they stay in the users’ memory.</p>
                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                <p>As a long-time practitioner of a Vedic spiritual discipline, bhakti-yoga, and a long-time Sanskrit student, I am aware of the useful tradition of memorising and quoting aphorisms and verses from Vedic, yogic, tantric, Buddhist and Jain scriptures and texts. Serious practitioners are encouraged to memorise, meditate upon and appropriately quote a good number of such shlokas (verses) and aphorisms (sutras). Traditionally students would develop their memories by learning and reciting them by rote on a daily basis in traditional home-based schools from early age. Today's environment does not afford us the luxury of using that method and most of us did not learn Sanskrit in our young years. Most learners have to use books or memory cards to accomplish this task. I know the frustration of leaving those at home and forgetting what I learned in the meantime. Since almost all of us carry our phones with us, this application would solve this problem along with a few others. It will offer the users the convenience of learning verses in their spare time, wherever they happen to be. I have needed this application for a long time and I know of many others who would use and benefit from it. </p>
                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>This application will come with some verses and aphorisms pre-installed and will also allow users to purchase and download additional verse packs from the cloud through the online store interface. The users will be able to choose the verses to learn, to display them on the learning screen and read, listen and recite along, as well as to analyse each word to understand how it fits into the text, as a memory aid. The dictionary translation and grammatical information about a word, such as its gender, number, grammatical case, conjugation, voice etc. will be displayed in the bottom section of the screen or a pop-up when the user taps on the word. A full translation of the verse will also be displayed below the Sanskrit verse. The user will be able to listen to proficient speakers of the language reciting the complete verse or individual words by tapping on special icons at the beginning of the verse or by double tapping on individual words respectively.</p>
                <p>Once they have achieved some confidence with committing the verse to memory, they will be able to switch to the recall and testing mode, in which the individual words will be obscured from their view. The users will test themselves on how well they memorised each line and mark them as complete. If the line is not fully memorised, the user will be able to display individual words (by tapping on them) and/or listen to their pronunciation (by double-tapping), until they are satisfied that the line is memorised. When all lines in the verse are marked as complete, the verse will be marked as memorised and will be presented to the user over different time intervals for spaced repetition to help with long-term memorisation by using system reminders. The application will also keep score of how many times a user has to look up individual words and will mark and highlight them to draw the user’s attention to those, both in the memorisation and recall and testing modes.</p>
                <p>The users will be able to create their own lists of verses and add verses to them. There will also be a statistics screen that will allow the user to track their progress and that will show them  the number of verses learned, the number of recalls, lists of difficult words etc. There may be a gamification component with virtual rewards and potentially friendly competitions with other users. </p>
                <p>The application will not rely on the internet connection except for downloading of new verse packs and possibly sharing and comparing the scores if the competition component is implemented.</p>

                <p>The application will be available for both iOS and Android devices (first mobile phone and then tablets) because it will be written using the cross-platform Flutter framework. </p>
                        
                <p>The future versions and spin-off applications based on this one may be used by school students to learn poems by heart (as is the custom in many educational systems in the world), by practitioners of other spiritual traditions for memorising Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic verses and sayings and by others willing to train and expand their memories. </p>

                <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
                <p>The application will be written using an Apple Macintosh or a Hackintosh computer or virtual device because this is a requirement for iOS development. The required IDEs are Android Studio and XCode. The Flutter SDK will also be installed. </p>
                <p>A number of Dart and Flutter packages and plugins will be required for handling user interaction and less conventional interface components, as well as data management.</p>
                <p>A mobile file-based database solution, such as SQLite, will be used to store the verses and the related information, as well as user progress data. </p>
                <p>Mobile devices, both iOS and Android, will be required for testing. </p>

                <h4>Skills Required</h4>
                <p>The skills required for this application will include  technical, cultural, linguistic and data entry.  From the technical point of view the developer will need to know how to use Dart and Flutter and their associated included and custom packages and plugins, such as graphical user interface components, audio file playback, database interfaces etc., as well as Android Studio, XCode, testing suites, AVD, user interface design, database design and management, and network file handling (for verse packs).  In the future versions, internationalisation will also be required.</p>

                <p>Someone will need to enter and format the verses, map each word to its complete and word-for-word translation and grammatical information, as well as to link them up with associated audio files and package them for download and import into the application. </p>
                        
                <p>Voice talent will be needed for recording those audio files. </p>
                
                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>If the project is successful, I am confident that hundreds and possibly thousands of users around the world will find it invaluable because it will help them solve several problems and help them achieve their individual memorisation goals. They will be able to replace their memory cards, bulky books, difficult-to-use (at least for this purpose) ebooks with a tool specifically designed with this one task in mind. They will be able to carry all the verses and aphorisms they want to learn in the pocket and access them whenever they have time for learning. They will no longer have to see the whole verse, when they are trying to remember and commit to memory specific words or lines. They will also be able to hear the verses and emulate the correct pronunciation. Hopefully, many will be able to learn a lot more verses than they are able to now.</p>
