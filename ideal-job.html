                <h3>Position description and its appeal to me</h3>
                <p>This job is for an Android engineer who will work on a new audio platform for online communities,
                    obviously in the mobile app space. What I find interesting about this job is that it involves
                    working with other brilliant engineers who worked on WhatsApp, Asana and Slack, that it involves
                    facilitating online communities (I love helping people connect online and offline), and that I will
                    be working remotely (I enjoy working alone and from home or a hotel and find it easier to
                    concentrate). I find it appealing that the codebase will be modern and not legacy (I have previously
                    worked on legacy codebase and did not enjoy it). </p>
                <h3>Skills and experience required</h3>
                <p>This job requires more than 5 years of experience in building native Android apps using modern
                    frameworks, such as Jetpack and ReactiveX etc. It requires great communication skills, especially
                    when working remotely with the team, which will be dispersed throughout different geographic
                    location. One would have to be able to work independently and stay motivated. </p>
                <h3>Skills and qualifications that I already have</h3>
                <p>The technical experience that I have is not directly what is required for this job, but I have years
                    of web development behind me and a rudimentary knowledge of Kotlin, Flutter and Swift and mobile
                    application development, from my previous studies and experiments. For example, I completed an RMIT
                    subject on iOS development in Swift. </p>
                <p>I am definitely able to work independently, having worked from home in a team with geographically
                    dispersed colleagues (from Sydney to countries in AsiaPac and the US) for ten years as a web
                    developer at Cisco Systems. </p>
                <h3>My plan to obtain required skills</h3>
                <p>I am completing a Flutter development course through Udemy (interrupted by this term of university
                    studies), which will give me enough knowledge to attempt my second mobile application in Flutter,
                    and Dart, followed by another two applications that I have planned. I will then do an Android Kotlin
                    development course in Udemy and possibly the Android Kotlin nanodegree from Udacity. I will then
                    write more apps or re-write my Flutter apps in Kotlin and start applying for Android developer jobs.
