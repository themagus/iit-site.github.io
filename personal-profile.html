                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Many Mediators (INFPs) long for a career that doesn’t just take care of the bills but also
                            feels
                            fulfilling. They want to spend their days doing something they genuinely love, preferably
                            without too much stress or drama. For these personalities, an ideal professional life should
                            feel like a calling, not just a job.</p>

                        <p>At times, idealistic Mediators might struggle to find a profession that meets their practical
                            needs and fulfills their dreams. They may drift in frustration, waiting for the perfect job
                            to
                            present itself and eventually feeling stuck or worried that they’re not living up to their
                            potential. Alas, there’s no such thing as a perfect job. The question of whether to settle
                            for a
                            less-than-ideal position can weigh heavily on people with this personality type.</p>

                        <h4>Mediator (INFP) careers</h4>
                        <p>Fortunately, Mediators stand out for their creativity, independence, and sincere desire to
                            connect with and help others. These traits can help them shine – and find fulfillment – in
                            nearly any line of work.</p>

                        <p>Mediators can succeed nearly anywhere, but certain fields seem to be especially attractive to
                            these personalities. With their curiosity and their love of self-expression, many Mediators
                            dream of becoming writers. They might write novels, seek out interesting freelance niches,
                            or
                            even find themselves doing communications in a corporate field or for a nonprofit
                            organization.
                            Richly imaginative, Mediators can infuse even the driest of fundraising or marketing
                            materials
                            with new life.</p>

                        <p>Nearly any field can benefit from Mediators’ artful communication style. As a result,
                            Mediators
                            may have their pick of jobs when choosing whether to work in the nonprofit or for-profit
                            sphere
                            – or for themselves.</p>
                        <p>Although these personalities aren’t known for seeking the spotlight, they may find their
                            life’s
                            purpose in the performing arts. Mediators are sensitive to artistic beauty, and some of them
                            simply come to life in the worlds of music, drama, or dance. These Mediators can draw from
                            their
                            inner depths to pull out exquisite interpretations of a creator’s work. Many Mediators also
                            create their own works as playwrights, composers, and choreographers.</p>

                        <p>Whatever they do, people with this personality type want to feel that their work is helping
                            others. As a result, some Mediators find it gratifying to work with clients face-to-face.
                            Service careers, such as massage therapy, physical rehabilitation, counseling, social work,
                            psychology, and even teaching can be exceptionally rewarding for Mediators, who take pride
                            in
                            the progress and growth that they help foster.</p>

                        <p>People with this personality type tend to put others’ interests ahead of their own. This is a
                            mixed blessing, as it can make it hard for them to establish a healthy work-life balance.
                            That
                            said, few things are more rewarding for Mediators than seeing their work help change
                            someone’s
                            life for the better.</p>

                        <p>
                            Mediators may find it demotivating to work in high-stress, bureaucratic, or hectic
                            environments.
                            They may also become frustrated by workplaces that are highly critical or competitive.
                            Workplaces that reward independence tend to be a good fit for Mediators, although they may
                            appreciate some structure and oversight to help them avoid procrastination and getting lost
                            in
                            thought.</p>

                        <p>That said, Mediators don’t need ideal conditions to thrive professionally. These
                            personalities
                            want to live in tune with their values, in their careers as much as in any other aspect of
                            their
                            lives. As long as they feel a strong sense of mission in their work, they can put up with –
                            and
                            overcome – any number of challenges.</p>

                        <p>Visual style is learning by seeing. You learn visually whenever you gain information from
                            sight.
                            This includes more than just the viewing of pictures and your surroundings. Visual learning
                            also

                <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
                <p>I think these results accurately reflect my behaviour in typical work situations and in formal contexts. For example, I tend to be reserved and prone to hiding from the spotlight; yet it is mainly when I am with those who I have a formal relationship with, such as bosses and colleagues. Once I know them better, I open up and become bolder in expressing my points of view. I know that I thrive when creativity is encouraged and welcome, and I can produce better results and unconventional solutions. I can communicate passionately and convincingly when I can trust those around me. </p>
                <p>Fortunately, my life credo and default attitude is to trust people unless they prove themselves untrustworthy. I like establishing new relationships and listening to people. It is no accident that my other careers are in coaching / counseling and language interpreting, both of which involve a lot of communication with people. Even though I am not an extravert, I have practised public speaking enough to come across confidently. </p>
                <p>I am not very well organised and appreciate non-intrusive reminders to plan and prioritise my work. As long as the planning horizon is not too far off and the scope of work in front of me is not too overwhelming, I usually manage to be quite productive. When working on individual projects, I appreciate working with another person to help me stay on track.</p>
                <p>As a learner, I do indeed usually prefer visual and auditory learning, although I am not limited to these two styles. I like watching and following visual courses, where instructors show how to do something and I can follow along. When it comes to less hands-on subjects, I like listening to and learning from audiobooks, audiocourses and podcasts. I also like attending live offline workshops and trainings when I can practise and be supervised and given feedback by an experienced instructor.</p>
                <p>While I love reading books, I have found that I am not enjoying learning skills from them. I like them for prompting deep thinking about philosophical and abstract concepts, as well as for learning soft skills.</p>
                <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
                <p>I know from experience how my personality would influence my behaviour in a team. Until I get to know my colleagues, I tend to quietly listen, watch and learn. I am not ready to give input or feedback unless I am well familiar with facts and context. Once I am satisfied that I have enough such information, I am happy to actively contribute although I prefer others to be in the spotlight. I like working in solitude and with as little disturbance and interference as possible, yet it does not mean that I do not maintain sufficient communication with the team. I just do not like being in a noisy and busy environment, always surrounded by people because I find it difficult to concentrate and produce my best work. I am conscientious and productive, and being relationship-oriented and socially-aware, I like helping both my colleagues and clients by offering my knowledge and skills. </p>
                
                <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
                <p>If I am the one forming a team, then I know I would need to complement or counteract my weaknesses by recruiting a team mate who is strong where I am weak. I guess the same should go for the teams, in which I am participating as a member. I need to be given enough autonomy and the time and environment to concentrate. I would prefer to be given space to observe and gather facts at first but I will play full out once I feel some solid ground under my feet. Perhaps a frontline leadership role may not be for me, yet I am happy and good at encouraging and even guiding teammates from the back. I would not be a good fit in a team, where micro-managing is part of the culture. I do not do well in environments with open desk and shared workspaces so it is best if I am given at least a modicum of privacy. I am quite methodical once I know what I am doing, so I can be responsible for writing and maintaining some of the back-end code. I am not very good at design, so I should not be given tasks involving visual presentation and visual appearance of the product.</p>
