                <h2 class="page-title">Interest in IT</h2>
                <p>I am interested in writing software, particularly mobile applications and their back end. </p>
                <p>I developed an interest in IT and programming when my dad built a simple computer based on the
                    electric circuitry blueprint published in a Soviet radio amateur magazine. My dad, of course, was
                    not an amateur but a radio engineer. I was about 13 and my younger brother and I would type up and
                    verify programs from the magazine - rows and columns of compiled machine code. Then Dad built a ZX
                    Spectrum clone and we were even more hooked. We played lots of games but also tried to write some of
                    our own in BASIC. That’s when I decided I would become a programmer. </p>
                <p>I enrolled in an applied maths and information technology degree, of which I only did one year before
                    moving abroad. Some time later I got to play with BBSs and early internet tools, like Gopher. In
                    1995, when WWW became big news, I decided I wanted to become a web developer. I learned HTML and
                    designed a couple of websites (I also learned that I suck at design and should stick to writing
                    code.)</p>
                <p>I managed to find a job as a junior programmer at CMS Transport Systems in Melbourne from 1999 until
                    2001, then joined Cisco Systems as a web editor in 2001, then lost my job in the Great IT Crash,
                    then re-joined Cisco Systems as a web developer in 2002 and worked there until the end of 2012 when
                    my contract was finally terminated and sent offshore. </p>
                <p>I tried to find another job in IT but after trying for a year, I gave up and found other non-IT jobs,
                    and I have been out of IT since early 2013.</p>
                <p>Since I still hoped to work in IT, I realised that I needed to re-skill and became more interested in
                    mobile application development, which is what I am pursuing now.</p>
                <p>The reason I chose to study at RMIT is that I wanted to get an IT degree to help me learn the missing
                    fundamentals that I might have missed in my previous studies and to have a degree to qualify for
                    some jobs that require it. </p>
                <p>I do not expect to learn much more in this degree than I already have, as these are my last three
                    subjects. I was hoping that what I would learn would qualify me for a job in IT, but it’s only
                    provided the basics and I realise that I need to spend a lot more time learning job market-required
                    skills through other study pathways before I can get a job. </p>
